              The researchers discovered dark UX patterns present in nearly half
              of all emails they received throughout the 2020 election. These
              ranged from forged replies to fake counters, meant to trick users
              into responding and sending money to campaigns and other political
              entities. In addition to searching the database, it was also
              imperative to educate users on these manipulations and teach them
              how to spot these tactics themselves.
